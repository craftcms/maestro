## Reseed

Persistent changes to the Craft version, content model, content in Europa Museum are made via updates to the seed database.

Start from a fresh import of `seed.sql` (without running `demos/seed`, which randomises news dates and adds fake Freeform submissions), make only the changes you need, and then run:

```sh
php craft demos/dump
```

It keeps only the latest revision of each element, deletes provisional drafts, trashed elements and Freeform submissions, and writes `seed.sql` without caches, sessions or logs, with each table's rows sorted. The diff then shows only what you changed. Commit it alongside the project config it matches.

The command changes the database it dumps, so run it on a working copy.
